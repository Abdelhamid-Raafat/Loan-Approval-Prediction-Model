# Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected**.  
Dataset: *Loan Approval Prediction* from Kaggle.  

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values.  
2. **Encoding** – converted categorical variables into numerical form.  
3. **Class Imbalance Handling** – used techniques to deal with imbalanced target classes.  
4. **Model Training** – trained classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
5. **Evaluation** – focused on **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** rather than just accuracy.  

## Results
- Achieved balanced performance between detecting approvals and rejections.  
- Precision and recall scores provided deeper insight into the model’s reliability.
